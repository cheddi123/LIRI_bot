LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

The user will make two input. Look at the code for directions of what input to use. 
Example: input1 can be "spofity-this" if you want song information and input2 can be the specifi song, i.e. "where is the love"
Look at the video link and relate it to the liri.js app to get a better understanding of how it works.

For example you can type the following in termnal : 
  node liri.js movie-this the avengers 

  You will get certain information about the avengers from the ombd API base the parameters set up. Look at the omdb function to see what are the parameters.
